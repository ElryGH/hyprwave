**Hyprwave** is a Hyprland configuration designed with a "less is more" philosophy. </br>
Based on [Hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots), it trims down unneeded extra features.

### Features:
- A streamlined, functional desktop experience
- Minimal setup and reduced clutter
- Easily customizable for your needs

### Disclaimer:
This configuration is tailored to my personal setup. </br>
Be sure to review and modify the following files to fit your own setup:
- `dotfiles/.config/hypr/wallpaper.conf`
- `dotfiles/.config/hypr/monitors.conf`
- Check the packages in `software.lst` and install only what's relevant to you.

**Why Hyprwave?** </br>
Hyprdots is awesome, but it does way too much. (Multiple layouts, waybars, wallpapers, etc) </br>
If you prefer a rice that focuses on style without overwhelming options, **Hyprwave** is the perfect fit.
